I worked on this project with 3 other team members. My main contributions include the highscores api that I added
I also made a memory matching game

## Highscores API
- The purpose of this feature is to input your time after playing the game and put it in the leaderboard to get a feedback for a certain score
- I worked on the highscores.html, highscores.js, and highscores.css code on the frontend. 

## Memory Matching Game
- For this game you could choose different game modes

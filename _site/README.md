I worked on this project with 3 other team members. My main contributions include the highscores api that I added
I also made a memory matching game. The purpose of the project that we created was to encourage students in school to stay educated while playing games. We had games that included chemistry elements for students to familiarize themselves with them while playing games. 

## Highscores API
- The purpose of this feature is to input your time after playing the game and put it in the leaderboard to get a feedback for a certain score
- I worked on the highscores.html, highscores.js, and highscores.css code on the frontend. 
- I worked on score.py in api, scorey.py in model, main.py, and scores.json
- All the basecode was from my teacher, which I modified to fit my feature

## Memory Matching Game
- For this game you could choose different game modes by grid size for difficulty
- I tried to incorporate chemistry elements into the game. All elements up to Argon are in the list that is shuffled to play the game
- I got the basecode from a github repository and modified it to fit my project

## Overall teacher basecode:
- All the code is from my teacher's basecode which I modified to fit my feature
